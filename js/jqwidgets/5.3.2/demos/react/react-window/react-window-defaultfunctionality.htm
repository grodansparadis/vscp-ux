        ReactJS Window demo. You can use the jqxWindow to direct a user’s attention to a particular activity in your application, such as entering data or viewing information. 
        Consider using a jqxWindow when you want greater customization, you want to block the user interface outside the window, or when you want to retrieve a DialogResult and other data from the popup window. 
        jqxWindow can be displayed as a modal dialog window that blocks user interaction with the underlying user interface or as a standard window without blocking the web page's user interface.
