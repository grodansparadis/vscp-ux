        This is an example of chart line series. The data is loaded in the chart from a csv file using JavaScript. The type of the seriesGroups setting is set to line. Setting the valuesOnTicks option enables the data to be shown for each date. You can also see how to set the xAxis labels under 45 degrees angle. In order to change the color scheme you have to set the colorScheme setting. The animation is enabled with the enableAnimations option.
