                                the Swiss Re Building (colloquially referred to as the Gherkin), is a skyscraper
                                in London's main financial district, the City of London, completed in December 2003
                                and opened at the end of May 2004. With 40 floors, the tower is 180 metres (591
                                ft) tall, and stands on the former site of the Baltic Exchange building, which was
                                severely damaged on 10 April 1992 by the explosion of a bomb placed by the Provisional
                                IRA.

                                The building is on the former site of the Baltic Exchange building, the headquarters
                                of a global marketplace for ship sales and shipping information. On 10 April 1992
                                the Provisional IRA detonated a bomb close to the Exchange, severely damaging the
                                historic Exchange building and neighbouring structures. The UK government's statutory
                                adviser on the historic environment, English Heritage, and the City of London governing
                                body, the City of London Corporation, were keen that any redevelopment must restore
                                the building's old façade onto St Mary Axe. The Exchange Hall was a celebrated fixture
                                of the ship trading company.
