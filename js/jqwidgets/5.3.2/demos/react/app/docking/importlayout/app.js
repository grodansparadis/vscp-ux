                            Before the RISC philosophy became prominent, many computer architects tried to bridge
                            the so called semantic gap, i.e. to design instruction sets that directly supported
                            high-level programming constructs such as procedure calls, loop control, and complex...

                            A database management system (DBMS) is a software package with computer programs
                            that control the creation, maintenance, and the use of a database. It allows organizations
                            to conveniently develop databases...

                            Some aspects attributed to the first RISC-labeled designs around 1975 include the
